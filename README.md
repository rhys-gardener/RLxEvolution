# RLxEvolution
First attempt at applying an evolutionary algorithm to Reinforcement Learning to improve action-space exploration/solution convergence. 

Currently this is focussed on solving a multi-agent problem (the kaggle 'hungry geese'). But in a future revision I will correct to general single/multi env environments.
